**Project Details:**

We expect a clearly articulated final deliverable for the project.

If the project utilizes legacy or other codebases, please specify this and link to applicable repos. In addition list any specific IP licenses you are utilizing. 

Where relevant please include mockups/designs of any UI/hardware components, API specifications of the core functionality.

It is often helpful to include an overview of the tech stack to be used, including any required dependencies. Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture or schematics to be deployed within or as the MVP is even better.

**Roadmap:**

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones.

Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the expected functionality plus how we can validate functionality.

Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered. The level of detail must be enough to later verify that the project meets the specification.

_MS/Roadmap EXAMPLE:_

| Milestone + Date | Deliverable | Summary | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MS1, Date | Figma UI/UX | A figma ui/ux full tech stack defined, we estimate 40 developer hours | 5,000 USD |
| MS2, Date | On-chain functionality | Core features implemented on-chain and deployed to HNT testnet, estimated at 20 developer hours | 2500 USD |
| MS3, Date | MVP | -Docker delivered to the DeWi foundation for mainnet testing. - repo is public - A Medium article and tutorial written on how to implement the new add-on which is published and linked in discord and forums, estimated at 25 core team hours | 2750 USD |
